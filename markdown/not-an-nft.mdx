# nfts: no frickin thanks

**summary:**
nfts are a waste.
coomer.org has memes you can sponsor for a little while, and nothing else.
or maybe something, we'll keep you posted -- but not an nft.

time, energy and money wasted on less than nothing.
anyone involved in nfts has sacrified people and planet to money, or is just plain gullible.
myopia: the mental and physical symptom of an overactive distracted mind.

**our promise!!**
we the people of coomer.org advocate for mass euthanasia of all grifters.
we vow to be very kind and loving, and we'll make the world a better place!

the tragic online grift economy succeeds in leading beings into sacrificing themselves to the money god -- better thought of as an actual entity, fyi -- cursed into sacrificing everything else to his insatiable demands.

he'll give you what you ask, but at the cost of everything else.

it's been going on for a while, anything single use or money from the money of others doesn't need to be that way. there seems to be no exception. though our conditioned minds will go crazy finding otherwise.

that seems to be the central dysfunction.

## a pleasant way to donate

eventually, the goal is a weighted depreciation algorithm that displays messages with a timer based on donations. you need to make sure that it's fair for people who donate a little bit or lots.

version one is the highest memes between posts in the meme scroll. then there's a bar below scrolling the most recent donation messages, and then you can hide using a cumPlus+ subscription so we can consistently predict income for [peaceful foundation](https://peacefulfoundation.org).

(perhaps the following rewards too?)

- discord ranks
- coomer.org email address
- physical rewards, such as pleasant shirts, eco-friendly stickers or even coffee table books
